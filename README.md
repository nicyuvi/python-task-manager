## Overview
Create a simple command-line task manager that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.

## Features
Add Task: Allow users to add tasks with a title and description. Each task should have a unique identifier.

View Tasks: Display a list of all tasks with their titles, descriptions, and identifiers.

Delete Task: Allow users to delete a task by entering its identifier.

Save to File: Save the tasks to a file so that they persist even after the program is closed. When the program starts, it should load the tasks from the file.

## Running Locally
- Install Python3*

```
python main.py
```
## Concepts learned:
- Basic data structures with `dict` 
- `with` keyword and it's use case with `open()`
- Basic OOP implementation with instance methods and methods running on instantiating a class
- User inputs
- try/except blocks for handling exceptions such as `KeyboardInterrupt`
